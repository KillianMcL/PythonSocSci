    "In programming, variables are like signposts that direct your computer to a location in its memory. For convenience, we can think of them as storing information in a program's 'working memory'. The kind of information that variables store are values (i.e., letters and numbers) and objects. These are often refered to as items or elements.<br><br>Python allows for flexible naming of variables, with few constraints. All of the examples below are valid variables."

    "There are 5 data types that can be assigned to variables, and which can be used in Python. When assigning values to variables, Python interprets the type of data you are intending to input. This is important - if `1,000` is stored as a word and not a number, Python will not allow you add to it. The data type of a variable determines what you can do to it, and how it can relate to other elements of your code.<br><br>The three major data types are:\n",
    "- **Strings:** Strings of letters, `str`\n",
    "- **Integers:** Whole numbers, `int`\n",
    "- **Floating points:** Numbers with decimal points, `float`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two types are:\n",
    "- **None/NaN:** Technically the absense of a value, but is represented within variables `None`\n",

Above, the variable we wanted to print is provided as an argument for one of the print function's parameters. When we called the `len()` function, it generated an integer, that was the function's return value.\n",

We use a function like `print()` without having to issue explicit instructions to Python about how to display text or varibales. All we need to do is call the function with one line of code.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "No variable created in a function, including its parameters, can be directly accessed outside its function. This is a genral principle of coding called **encapsulation**. Encapsulation helps keep independent code separate from the **global scope** of your program, by hiding or encapsulating the details in a **local scope**. That's why you use parameters and return values: to communicate just the information that needs to be exchanged. Plus, you don't have to keep track of variables you create within a function in the rest of your program. \n",
